# Improved-K-Means-
We have performed both Standard as well as Improved K mean cluster on this data set with an assumption that the number of clusters =2. K-means is a typical clustering algorithm, and it is widely used for clustering large sets of data. This new algorithm is an improved version of K-Means algorithm, means this algorithm analyses the shortcomings of the standard k-means clustering algorithm and improves them. Because the computational complexity of the standard k-means algorithm is objectionably high owing to the need to reassign the data points several times during every iteration, which makes the efficiency of standard k-means clustering not high. 
This code implementation of the paper presents a simple and efficient way for assigning data points to clusters. The proposed method in this implemented algorithm ensures the entire process of clustering in O(nk) time without sacrificing the accuracy of clusters. Experimental results shows the improved algorithm can improve the execution time of k-means algorithm. So the proposed k-means method is feasible.
